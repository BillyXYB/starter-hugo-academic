I am a M.S.R student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. [Shubham Tulsiani](https://shubhtuls.github.io).I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Chi-Keung TANG](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/cktang),  Prof. [Yu-Wing TAI](https://yuwingtai.github.io), Prof. [Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org)@HKUST.

My current research focuses on enhancing procedural creativity and advancing media production for the movie, gaming, and VR industries. This includes developing tools to help artists and developers automate workflows, innovate in design and animation, and improve the diversity and quality of 3D asset creation. 

Iâ€™m looking for a Ph.D position starting from 2025 Fall!
